# Glossary

When reviewing the magma guide, you may stumble across some unfamiliar concepts
and highly technical terms. If you encounter an undefined term that is difficult
for you to understand, please feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/lavafeld/magma-guide/issues/new) to request
the definition be added to this glossary. Similarly, more experienced users
should feel free to [contribute](contribute.md) and add new terms to the
glossary whenever they see fit.

This glossary, like all other sections of the magma guide, will be updated on a
rolling basis.
